# Your home page

This is your home page! It's the `index.md` file in the repository.

It is written using Markdown so that the underlying code is much easier to edit that raw HTML.

For more information about setting up your site and how things are organized, see the `Website Guides` tab.

For more on adding features to your pages, see the documentation under the `Page Components` tab.
